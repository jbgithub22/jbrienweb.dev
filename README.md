### A space in the internet for me to do my experiments.

Hi! This is my practice zone for web development, cloud engineering and devops.

## Current hosting specifications for this website:
1. Domain purchased from Namecheap.com.
2. Hosting is on an AWS EC2 Ubuntu Instance running Apache2.
3. I use VSCode and Github for version control.
4. Deployment with github actions CI/CD: On git push command on VSCode, Github actions automatically update files on the AWS EC2 server. Changes to website are reflected as per DNS propagation update duration.
