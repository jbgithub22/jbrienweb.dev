### A space in the internet for me to do my experiments.

Hi! This is my practice zone for web development, cloud engineering and devops.

## Current hosting specifications for this website:
1. Domain purchased from Namecheap.com.
2. Hosting is on an AWS EC2 Ubuntu Instance running Apache2.
3. I use VSCode and Github for version control.
4. Deployment from Github to the EC2 server is currently manual: I download the repo from inside the server. The website was previously auto-deployed via webhook when it was in Hostinger, but I was having issues with SSH credentials. Still under troubleshooting.

## Project Pipeline

### Web Development
1. More dynamic design.
2. Comment/Feedback forms.
3. Mini-games.
4. Event calendar manager.
5. Photography portfolio website.
6. Some machine learning/pytorch project.
7. Some data viz project from Singapore Gov's data APIs.
8. Chat App.

### Cloud Engineering
1. Learn more on the capabilities of AWS EC2 and the industry workflows around it.

### Dev-Ops
1. Settling version control to my Laptop so the files are in sync.
