<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
  I graduated with a Diploma in Architecture from Singapore Polytechnic in 2014; went for the Singaporean National Service for 2 years: 
  First in the Singapore Armed Forces for 4 months followed by the rest of the 2 years in the Singapore Police Force.
</p>
<p>
  I started work as a Drafter for a 20-person Architectural Firm. I took on responsibilities of an Architectural Assistant 1 month later, 
  and then as a Lead Project Designer about 6 months later. 
  After the main project I was handling was completed, I resigned to pursue a degree.
</p>
<p>
  I went to Singapore University of Technology & Design for the first year curriculum: 
  Undergraduate-level mathematics, physics, biology and chemistry is compulsory in the first year.
  I dropped out for a plethora of reasons: The tuition was expensive and I felt that I already had my fun in the architectural industry, amongst other things.
</p>
<p>
  I then worked as a manufacturing technician in Thermofisher (Biotech) and followed by Rolls-Royce (Aerospace). The experiences of which, I will be able to use in some future work.
